Saving Pages

The function saveHandler will handle the submission of forms located on the edit pages. After uncommenting the related line in main, let's implement the handler:

func saveHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    title := r.URL.Path[len("/save/"):]
    body := r.FormValue("body")
    p := &Page{Title: title, Body: []byte(body)}
    p.save()
    http.Redirect(w, r, "/view/"+title, http.StatusFound)
}

The page title (provided in the URL) and the form's only field, Body, are stored in a new Page. The save()method is then called to write the data to a file, and the client is redirected to the /view/ page.

The value returned by FormValue is of type string. We must convert that value to []byte before it will fit into the Page struct. We use []byte(body) to perform the conversion.
